% Overview:    This function is used as the initialisation for the segmentation
%              algorithm. Peaks in the 2D summary image(s) are identified 
%              as candidate ROIs. Peaks are found with an built-in MATLAB 
%              image processing function 'imextendedmax'. Peaks with 
%              relative height (with respect to their neighbours) that are 
%              less than alpha x sigma are suppressed. Here, sigma is
%              the standard deviation of the summary image and alpha is a 
%              tuning parameter.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   INPUTS    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% metric                     MxN summary image of video, usually the
%                            pixelwise cross-correlation (see crossCorr.m)
% radius                     radius of a cell
% alpha                      tuning parameter, peaks below alpha*sigma will be
%                            suppressed
% options                    A variable of type struct. In the following we
%                            describe the fields of this struct. 
% options.blur_radius        [Default: 1] If present, this is the radius of
%                            blurring applied to the summary images. 
%                            blurred with radius options.blur_radius.
% options.secondary_metric   M x N array corresponding to a summary image,
%                            e.g. the mean image. If this field is present, 
%                            initialisation is  performed on both the first 
%                            argument 'metric' and a second summary image. The value
%                            options.second_alpha (the value of alpha for the
%                            second summary image) must also be present.
